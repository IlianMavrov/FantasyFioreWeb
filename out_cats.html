                    <p> We are small cattery breeding British shorthair cats and we doing it with all love in the world</p>

                    <p>The origins of the British Shorthair most likely date back to the first century AD, making it one of the most ancient identifiable cat breeds in the world.[citation needed] These cats were imported by the Romans who kept them to keep
                        the camps clear of snakes, mice and bugs. These cats then interbred with the local European wildcat population. Over the centuries, their naturally isolated descendants developed into distinctively large, robust cats with a short
                        but very thick coat, to better withstand conditions on their native islands. Based on artists' representations, the modern British Shorthair is unchanged from this initial type.</p>
